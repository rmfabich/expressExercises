//try to get this working - just rendering your index.html file like you've done before. Don't read the stuff below 
//until you get it working, lest you'll be a cheater and a pumpkin eater.

//The req and res parameters are really important. You can name them whatever you want, but the names should
//probably reflect what they are - the request object and the response object. 

//Here's an example of when you might use them - perhaps a user is trying to log into your application and he/she 
//passes his or her username and password. You'll grab that information off your REQUEST object - because your request
//object is the object sent TO your server. It is a request. And you give it a response. If his/her password matches, 
//then you can pass "successfully logged in" into your RESPONSE object - because the response is the object sent FROM your
//server

//use postman to call /authenticate, passing in a username and password that exists in the "database" variable
//you'll need use the correct HTTP method - app.post NOT app.get
//hint: you'll need to import some middleware to parse request bodies.
//It still doesn't work, read the code below and try to get it to respond with "you successfully logged in"


app.post("/authenticate", (req, res)=>{
   var match = db.find((entry)=>{
       if (entry.userName ===  req.body.hotdog){
           res.json("you successfully logged in");

           res.json("password/username don't match");

    }
    
});

app.listen(5000, function() {
   console.log("Listening on 5000");
});


//Lastly - create a new route and handler that responds with a username's email from a request object that contains the username
//use /authenticate to figure it how to do it. Use Postman to test it.
