# expressExercises

Each file (*js) is a server itself. You don't need to make multiple index.html files, each server file can grab the same index.html.
There might be an exercise that requires you to make another index.html file.

I'm not feeling comfortable with how we're going over jwt's yet. I haven't introduced middleware for checking auth, but
I can't do that without a front end. I might have to do that when we build something with the whole stack. I also don't want
to ONLY work on express. Id like to incorporate react into these somehow. We don't really have a way of testing it either.
