//copy the boilerplate from reqRes.js
//create some fake data (an array of object), set it equal to a const. 

//create some routes and handlers to serve different parts of the data object. You'll be passing in data through the req.body, 
//like you did in reqRes.js. Utilize the proper http method.

//for example, if I created an array of furniture, I could return all the objects that contained the property "isChair === true"

//using req.body properties to id particular objects:

  //create a route for returning a particular object in your data. 
  //create a route for updating a particular object in your data.
  //create a route for deleting a particular object in your data. 
  //create a route for adding a new object into your data. 
  
// you just created a crud server! nice work.
